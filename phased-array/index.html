		<h3>Wtf is this?</h3>
		<p>
			This is a simulation of a 'Patch Antenna' or 'Phased Array Antenna' consisting of several small, omnidirectional antennas. Such a collection of antennas is sometimes called '<em>Array</em>'. The purpose of this simulation is to visualize how such an antenna works. You can clearly see how there is a very strong radio wave in the middle (that bright, striped section). This part is called the 'main lobe' in antenna-speak or 'beam' in normal-people-speak. The main lobe is the part of the transmitter energy that goes towards the target. In other words: It's the useful part of the energy you put into the antenna, since it's the part of the energy that'll arrive at the target. If you build a directional antenna, most of the energy should be transmitted through the main lobe. Next to the main lobe you can see some areas that aren't quite as bright as the main lobe. These are called 'side lobes'. Usually these should be kept as small/weak as possible, since they 'steal' energy from the main lobe.

			This directionality I just explained can be achieved with any directional antenna, such as Parabolic Antennas. So why are Phased Arrays so much cooler than plain old parabolic antennas? Well, they have an ace up their sleeves: They can move the main lobe/beam without physically moving the antenna. If you have a parabolic antenna, you have to physically move the antenna to move the antenna's beam. With a phased array you don't have to do that. Phased Arrays move the beam electronically by shifting the phase of the smaller antennas' signal (that's why they're called <em>Phased</em> Array Antenna). Since moving the beam electronically is a lot faster than moving an antenna physically, these antennas can scan an area a lot faster than conventional antennas.
