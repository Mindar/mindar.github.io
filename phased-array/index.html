		<h3>Wtf is this?</h3>
		<p>
			This is a simulation of a 'Patch Antenna' consisting of 5 small, omnidirectional antennas. The purpose of this simulation is to visualize how a patch antenna works. You can clearly see how there is a very strong radio wave in the middle (that bright, striped section). This part is called the 'main lobe' in antenna-speak. You can also see some not quite as bright areas next to the main lobe. These areas are called 'side lobes'. Usually you want the side lobes to be as weak as possible<sup>1</sup>, because they 'steal' energy from the main lobe.

			<sup>1</sup>at least for directional antennas such as the big radar dishes you've probably seen at some point
